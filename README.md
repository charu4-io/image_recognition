# üöÄ Vision AI in 5 Days ‚Äî Image Recognition Bootcamp
**Deep Learning | Google Colab | TensorFlow/Keras**

## üìå About This Project
**Vision AI in 5 Days** is a hands-on, project-based journey into modern computer vision.  
Built and tested entirely in **Google Colab**, this bootcamp walks through the full image recognition pipeline ‚Äî from data preprocessing to transfer learning ‚Äî while following industry best practices.

### **Day-by-Day Roadmap**
- **Day 1:** Dataset download (CIFAR-10), OpenCV-based resizing, normalization, and visualization  
- **Day 2:** Building & training a CNN from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Day 3:** Data augmentation, precision/recall/F1-score, confusion matrix visualization  
- **Day 4:** Transfer learning with MobileNetV2, fine-tuning for improved performance  
- **Day 5:** Model evaluation (ROC/AUC), saving/loading models, and deployment tips
